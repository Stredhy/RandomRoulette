# Random Roulette by Stredhy

</center>

___

I don't want to depend on websites, that's why I created my own roulette, because sometimes I cannot be agreed with any idea.

This program was developed in java language, with JavaFX for UI/UX from maven dependencies, code wrote in Apache NetBeans IDE.

I wrote this program in modules just with 3 or 4 classes for it works well, here I'll explain how it is working and what do each module.
